When John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe, developed the Portable Document Format (PDF), he wanted to make it easier for people to distribute documents without the need to print them. Surprisingly, it didn’t turn out to be very user-friendly.

Not only were the files large in size, but the format didn’t support external hyperlinks and could only be viewed with a special PDF viewer. Over time, functional improvements were included in various versions of the PDF file format.

The good news is that there are several ways to edit a PDF document. We’re going to show you four great tools that make it possible.
